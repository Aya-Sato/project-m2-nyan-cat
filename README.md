## The Game

This game is called **Trick 'r Treat**. In the game, you play as a jack-o'-lantern candy bucket. The only thing you can do is move left or right with the arrows of your keyboard.

The goal of the game is to stay alive as long as possible by avoiding the ghosts while collecting candies to gain points. The more candies you catch, the higher your score!

## Modifications
- Increased the size of the gameboard.
- Instead of completely stopping the game when it's over, allowed the player to start a new game.
- Added levels and a countdown timer.
- Added two types of bonus candies (one type for level 1&2 and two types for level 3) that also fall from the sky and add points to the score (the higher the level, the higher the points for catching the candies).
- Increased the difficulty of the game as the levels go up by making the ghosts and the candies go faster, as well as by increasing the number of ghosts.
- Added a sound track and sound effects (i.e., for picking up candies, clearing the levels, losing/winning the game).
